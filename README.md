## 2. Description
We generated a website, in which we tried to show the fingerprint of the user who is surfing the internet using browser fonts, plugins installed, your ram size, hard disk size, etc and to how unique the user is being identified on internet, which nowadays third party cookies are blocking them for user's privacy due to which user's who do fraud are unable to get tracked down easily.

This project will track users uniquely irrespective of 3rd party cookies and many other things which are blocking us to get the fingerprint of a user uniquely. In this Project, we have shown the fingerprint score of user online, calculating fingerprint confidence score, calculating browser fingerprint value, plugins installed on your laptop, your fonts and calculating various fingerprint values like audio fingeprrint, canvas fingerprint, webRTC, etc.
Till now, we have achieved an acuracy score of 0.83(by implementing various fingerprinting techniques) to which users can be tracked down accurately and we are planning to increase the confidence score(the accuracy score about which more is explained below down in the paragraph) more upto 99.99%.
